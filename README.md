# sound_analysis

Basic sound analysis and visualization tools in parallel to adasynth C++ project

The goal is to find ways to model the sound of a tone and generate model files that the additive C++ synth ("adasynth") resynthesizes

The progress of the project can be followed on the Wiki

# What I have learned so far

- librosa python library

- Basics of signal analysis

- Basics of time series modeling/prediction

- Simple Python command line interface for quick prototyping
